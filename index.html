                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>With 5 years of professional experience in backend development, application development, machine learning and DevOps, I am passionate about building secure, scalable and efficient software systems.
                    I am recent graduate with master's degree in Computer Science, with a focus on machine learning, computer vision and biometric authentication.</p>
                <p>During my academic and professional journey, I got the opportunity to work on my capabilities of solving real-world problems
                     through the use of technology and software development. I am proficient in maintaining automated data pipelines and
                      high-volume applications. My technical expertise includes leveraging AI and neural networks to optimize systems and enhance security, 
                      particularly in projects like securing face recognition systems using locality-sensitive hashing.
                </p>
                <p>I am looking for full-time opporunities and I am eager to contribute to innovative solutions that not only advance technology but also
                     create an impact in the real world.</p>
